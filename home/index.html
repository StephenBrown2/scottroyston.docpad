    22nd Annual OPA National Exhibition</p>
</div>

<p>Born February 2, 1974 in Baltimore County, Maryland, Scott was educated in the Baltimore
County Public School System through the ninth grade. In September &#39;90, out of 500
applicants, he was one of ninety accepted into the Baltimore School for the Arts, located
in downtown Baltimore City, and graduated in June &#39;93 with a degree in Visual Arts. It was
during his junior year at the BSFA that he first learned of the Schuler School of Fine Arts
and in the summer of &#39;92, he started attending their six-week summer session. In October
&#39;94, he started full time at the school, including their night classes held two nights a
week, and graduated in May &#39;98. He went on to complete his Graduate Year (fifth year) at
Schulers in May &#39;99. Scott now hopes, with the knowledge and discipline that he has gained,
to one day become a successful artist and to pass on to others the traditions of the Old
Masters through teaching, both privately and in group lessons.</p>
<p>During the summers of &#39;90 through &#39;92, he was accepted into the two-week Summer Center
for the Arts program at Goucher College. One of the courses offered was entitled &quot;Studio
Painting and Drawing&quot; which he attended for all three years.</p>
<p>Since 1995, he attended various workshops, which were offered at the Schuler School.
These were taught by Schuler graduate and prior instructor, Jerome Atherholt. Artist and
prior graduate, Will Wilson, also came to the school to give demonstrations during the
course of each school year. In addition, Scott studied three years from &#39;97 to &#39;99 under
the direction of artist and former graduate of the Schuler School, Matt Zoll. Scott
continues to broaden his scope of studies and knowledge of the arts through his travels
within the United States as well as abroad throughout Italy, Switzerland, Spain and
France.</p>
<p>Since 1993, Scott&#39;s paintings are included in many private collections throughout the
United States and as far away as Canada and Scotland.</p>
<p>In October 1996, he entered into the York Art Association&#39;s 26th Open Juried Exhibition
and became the first person ever to receive all three awards &ndash; First Place in Oil/Acrylic
Category, Best of Show and the Invitational Group Exhibition Award held in April of 1998.
The distinguished jurors for this exhibit were Leslie C. Ehrin, Director, Corporate Art
consultant and Painting Manager for the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and Nora E. Klorfine,
Chairman, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Art Sales and Rental Gallery, who immediately invited
him to show his work in their gallery. In June 1999 and again in June 2002, Scott was one
of five artists selected to receive &quot;The Rottler Award for Excellence in the Visual Arts&quot;
which included a Group Exhibit at the York Art Association the following year.</p>
<p>Out of 1,200 entries, Scott&#39;s painting was one of 87 works chosen for Exhibit III, Works
by Contemporary Maryland Artists 2000 in the Conservatory Room, Government House,
Annapolis, MD. This exhibition was sponsored by First Lady Frances Hughes Glendening as
part of the &quot;Celebration for the Arts in Maryland&quot;.</p>
<p>Scott was chosen by &quot;The Artist&#39;s Magazine&quot; as a Finalist in the Still Life Category in
the 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2006 (2) Art Competitions. In the 2001 Art
Competition, he was included in their 2002 Limited Edition Wall Calendar. Scott also won
Honorable Mention in the Still Life Category in the 2004 Art Competition, which was
featured in their December 2004 issue. In the Artist&#39;s Magazine&#39;s Special 20th Anniversary
Issue, January 2004, Scott was named in their feature article &quot;On the Rise&quot; as one of
twenty artists to watch and who are destined to be masters painters of the future. Later in
their August 2004 issue, a five page feature article &quot;Handing Over the Keys&quot; by Scott
Royston was published. Although Scott has been a part of many articles in various artist
magazines, Scott has since gone on to publish &quot;Fine-Tuned Drawing with a Paint Brush&quot;,
International Artist Magazine, December/January 2007 Issue No. 52, &quot;Masterstrokes&quot;, Oil
Painter of America Brushstrokes Members Newsletter, Summer 2007, Volume 17, Issue 2, and
&quot;Painting Classical Floral Still Lifes with Skill and Understanding&quot;, American Artist,
November 2008, and many others.</p>
<p>In 2005, Scott was one of the top ten finalists in the International Artist Magazine&#39;s
Challenge 29: Still Life and Florals Competition. In 2006, he was also one of the top ten
Finalists in the magazine&#39;s Challenge 32: Flowers and Gardens Competition.</p>
<p>In April 2002, Scott was approached by Mr. Henry H. Nixon, Executive Director, and Ms.
Hannelore Schreiber, Vice President, of the York Symphony Orchestra. They chose one of his
Floral paintings to hang at all concert performances and various locations in York, PA
during the 2002-2003 Symphony Season, be on the cover and included in their Program
reaching over 20,000 subscribers, and to be auctioned with the winning announced on April
12, 2003 at the end of the Symphony Season.</p>
<p>In November 2004 Scott was presented with the AAPL Medal of Honor plus Award in the Oil
&amp; Polymer Awards Category of the 76th Grand National Exhibition of the American Artists
Professional League at the Salmagundi Club in New York, NY.</p>
<p>Since November 2001, Scott has been an associate member of the Oil Painters of America.
In August 2004, Scott was invited to become an associate member of the International Guild
of Realism and in their first annual juried exhibition held March 2005 at the Pan American
Art Gallery, Dallas, TX, was awarded Best Still Life for his oil painting. In 2005, he
became an associate member of the Arnot Art Museum.</p>
<p>More recently in May 2006, Scott won the People&#39;s Choice Award, Merit Award for Still
Life and the Jury&#39;s Top 50 Award at the Salon International 2006, International Museum of
Contemporary Masters, Greenhouse Gallery, San Antonio, TX. There were participants from 42
states and 15 countries in this juried exhibition. He was also invited to participate in
their International Masters of Fine Art held in October 2006.</p>
<p>Scott was recently notified that he will be part of the Smith Kramer Traveling Art
Exhibition: &quot;The New Reality: The frontier of Realism in the 21st Century&quot;, which will
begin either in late 2007 or early 2008 and continue through 2010.</p>
<p>His other talents include figure skating and writing. His professional experiences
include being accepted to tour with Walt Disney&#39;s &quot;World on Ice&quot; in the summer of &#39;93, and
with On Ice Inc.&#39;s &quot;Nutcracker on Ice&quot; in November and December of &#39;95. He has always had a
love for the subjects of mystery and psychological horror and has completed writing a novel
titled <em>Joshua</em> which he hopes to have published in the future.</p>
